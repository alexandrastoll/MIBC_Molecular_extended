# MIBC Molecular extended

Code for extended experiments for doctoral thesis of Alexandra Stoll currently under review:

Includes training Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models using a 5-fold cross-validation on top of pre-extracted feature embeddings from UNI2-h for molecular subtype prediction in muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer.
